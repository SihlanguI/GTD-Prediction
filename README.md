# GTD-Prediction

In this project we are going to build a models that can predict which terrorist group may have been responsible for the terrorist attack incident. Features like weapon, attack type and many more others will be used to predict.

Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2014. Some portion of the attacks have not been attributed to a particular terrorist group.
